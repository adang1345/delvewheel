## 1.7.3 <sub><sup>(_6 August 2024_)</sup></sub>
- Don't vendor the free-threaded Python DLL, e.g. `python313t.dll`.
- Restore mangling of Visual C++ runtime redistributable DLLs. The problem this was meant to solve has been found to have a different cause.
- Clear the `/DEPENDENTLOADFLAG` value for any `.pyd` or vendored DLLs (except those added with `--add-dll`). This ensures that the default DLL search path for Python extension modules is not overridden.

## 1.7.2 <sub><sup>(_1 August 2024_)</sup></sub>
- Improve analysis of wheel tags. This improves support for future versions of Python through 3.99. It is expected that for most future Python releases, no explicit support will need to be implemented. 
- Add Documentation and Changelog links to PyPI.
- Don't mangle Visual C++ runtime redistributable DLLs. Mangling of these DLLs was added in version 1.3.3. More recent considerations have indicated that mangling these DLLs offers questionable benefit. Also, it is believed that at least one of these DLLs uses process-global state, and having 2 versions in the same process can cause DLL load errors.

## 1.7.1 <sub><sup>(_3 July 2024_)</sup></sub>
- Support for Python 3.13, including experimental free-threaded wheels.

## 1.7.0 <sub><sup>(_20 June 2024_)</sup></sub>
- Update tests to use Python 3.12.
- Describe name-mangling in more detail in the README.
- Rename `--ignore-in-wheel` to `--ignore-existing`. `--ignore-in-wheel` will continue to be supported
as an alias.
- Introduce the `--analyze-existing` option to vendor dependencies of DLLs that already exist in the wheel.

## 1.6.0 <sub><sup>(_17 April 2024_)</sup></sub>
- Introduce the `--include-imports` flag to vendor `.lib` import library files along with DLLs.

## 1.5.4 <sub><sup>(_7 March 2024_)</sup></sub>
- Support abi3 wheels for Python 3.9 and 3.10 for Windows ARM64.
- Fix regression where wheel contents were not compressed.

## 1.5.3 <sub><sup>(_5 March 2024_)</sup></sub>
- Support `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable for reproducible builds.
- Support docstrings delimited using 1 double-quote or 1 single-quote when inserting the `.py` patch.

## 1.5.2 <sub><sup>(_18 December 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Improve internal and external documentation.
- Fix `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` when using Windows Store version of Python.
- Fix error handling when calling kernel32 functions.

## 1.5.1 <sub><sup>(_14 September 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Copy wheel as-is to destination if no external dependencies are needed.
- Don't vendor DLLs required by `python_d.exe` for debug wheels.
- Place `.py` patch after header comment and shebang if either exists.
- Display warning if wheel seems to have a namespace package that's not specified in `--namespace-pkg`.
- Fix handling of special characters in filenames in `RECORD` file.

## 1.5.0 <sub><sup>(_8 August 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Make whitespace around the `.py` patch prettier.
- Use the term "overlay" in code and documentation to describe PE file trailing data.
- Ignore `.pyd` files in `.data` directory outside of `.data/purelib` and `.data/platlib`.
- Don't vendor debug versions of CPython DLLs (e.g. `python3_d.dll`).
- Introduce the `--include-symbols` option to vendor debug symbol files along with DLLs.

## 1.4.0 <sub><sup>(_20 July 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Introduce support for namespace packages with the `--namespace-pkg` option.
- Move "updating RECORD" message to verbose mode.

## 1.3.8 <sub><sup>(_20 June 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Remove unnecessary import from `__init__.py` patch.
- Update tests to account for removal of attribute certificate table when name-mangling, a change that first appeared in release 1.3.3.
- Ignore dependency from `msvcp140.dll` to `concrt140.dll` because this dependency appears to be unnecessary after Windows XP.

## 1.3.7 <sub><sup>(_16 May 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Provide the C source code for a delay-load import hook.
- Remove load order calculation. The `.load-order` file still exists to aid in loading DLLs for Python 3.7 or lower, but it no longer contains the DLLs in any particular order. This change was made previously in 1.3.3, was reverted in 1.3.4, and is now restored.
- Check for directory and file existence in the `__init__.py` patch. This improves compatibility with repackaging tools that relocate the vendored DLLs.
- Don't vendor `vcruntime140.dll` for PyPy3.10.

## 1.3.6 <sub><sup>(_18 April 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Use Unix-style line endings for `.load-order` file.
- Add `--no-diagnostic` flag to avoid writing diagnostic information to `DELVEWHEEL` metadata file.

## 1.3.5 <sub><sup>(_24 March 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Revert the improved support for delay-load DLLs. This change caused other problems, and delay-load DLLs don't seem to be used too widely anyway.
- Document that support for delay-load DLLs is limited.

## 1.3.4 <sub><sup>(_8 March 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Restore the load order calculation because it turns out to be necessary for improving support for delay-load DLLs.
- Improve support for delay-load DLLs.

## 1.3.3 <sub><sup>(_27 February 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Clarify the supported platforms in the README.
- Improve comments and docstrings.
- Remove load order calculation. The `.load-order` file still exists to aid in loading DLLs for Python 3.7 or lower, but it no longer contains the DLLs in any particular order.
- Preserve line endings when patching `__init__.py`.
- Remove attribute certificate table when name-mangling. This also removes the Visual C++ redistributable DLLs from the no-mangle list. They will now be name-mangled by default.

## 1.3.2 <sub><sup>(_21 February 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Fix the calculation for the `SizeOfImage` and `SizeOfInitializedData` PE headers during name-mangling.
- During name-mangling, if enough internal padding space exists within a DLL, use this space to write the new dependency names instead of creating a new PE section. This allows us to name-mangle the dependencies of a DLL containing trailing data as long as enough padding space exists.
- Remove `libwinpthread` from the default no-mangle list.

## 1.3.1 <sub><sup>(_16 February 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Improve error message if `--strip` fails to remove all trailing data.
- Correct the calculation that determines whether a DLL contains trailing data if the last entry in the PE section header does not correspond to the last section of the PE file.
- Remove the `machomachomangler` dependency. `delvewheel` now takes full responsibility for DLL name-mangling.

## 1.3.0 <sub><sup>(_10 February 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Use Unix line endings for the `RECORD` and `DELVEWHEEL` metadata files.
- Improve error message in name-mangling step when a DLL has trailing data.
- Preserve the order of paths specified with `--add-path`.
- Introduce the `--strip` flag to automatically strip DLLs with trailing data during the name-mangling step.

## 1.2.0 <sub><sup>(_7 January 2023_)</sup></sub>
- Drop support for Python 3.6. Python 3.7+ will be required to run `delvewheel` itself. Wheels with a target Python version of 3.6 can still be repaired.
- Don't vendor DLLs included with CPython 3.9 or 3.10 arm64 for wheels targeting those versions.
- Make the `DELVEWHEEL` metadata file more structured.
- Add tests for wheels that have no external DLL dependencies.
- Include `delvewheel` version in help menu.

## 1.1.4 <sub><sup>(_4 December 2022_)</sup></sub>
- Add Python 3.12 to trove classifiers.
- Don't vendor DLLs required by CPython 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3 for wheels targeting those versions.
- Validate DLL names provided as arguments.
- Improve Anaconda Python detection.
- Use wheel distribution name in hash for name-mangling.

## 1.1.3 <sub><sup>(_4 December 2022_)</sup></sub>
- Withdrawn due to a mistake in the release process.

## 1.1.2 <sub><sup>(_15 November 2022_)</sup></sub>
- For `abi3` wheels, don't include DLLs included with Python.
- Don't assume `vcruntime140_1.dll` is present for Python 3.8 x64.
- Don't vendor DLLs included with CPython 3.12.

## 1.1.1 <sub><sup>(_4 November 2022_)</sup></sub>

- Remove the Visual C++ runtime redistributable directory from the default search path.

## 1.0.1 <sub><sup>(_29 September 2022_)</sup></sub>
- Add unit tests for more Python versions and platforms.
- Avoid including `libpypy3.9-c.dll` when repairing a PyPy3.9 wheel.
- Avoid `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` during name-mangling step when running `delvewheel` in PyPy.

## 1.0.0 <sub><sup>(_26 September 2022_)</sup></sub>
- Label project as production/stable.

## 0.0.20 <sub><sup>(_20 February 2022_)</sup></sub>
- Remove the limitation where the bitness of Python interpreter must match the bitness of the wheel.
- Ensure that the search for `.pyd` files is case-insensitive. Previously, extension modules would be missed if the `.pyd` extension was not all lowercase.

- Fix a bug where using `--add-dll` can cause failures during the name-mangling step.
